This is a little dictionary that uses fuzzy search to look up a database of English translation of old Italian words. The reference is from 1611 Florio's Italian-English Dictionary (http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/florio/)

The search includes both single word search with 10 relevant/similar results and text search.
